## Description
The car dealership inventory API is a system designed to streamline the management of cars for sale. With this API, users can easily view and manage the inventory of cars, including retrieving key information such as make, model, year, and price. This idea was born out of a passion for cars and a desire to improve the car-buying experience for everyone.
