The different Endpoints one can use are:
 - GET/Cars: this will return a list of cars in the dealership's inventory
 - POST/Cars: will add a new car to the inventory
 - DELETE/Cars/CarId: will delete a car from the inventory based on the CarId specified

 The main Http methods that I implemented are get, delete, and post
